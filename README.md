# alx-low_level_programming (**C Programming language)
I would first like to thank [Fred Swaniker](https://twitter.com/FredSwaniker) and [Julien Barbier](https://twitter.com/julienbarbier42) and the whole ALX community for giving us the opportunity to learn.

## Description  

The repository is about C programming language which was develop in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.It's is called `low level programming` since it is a process of writing computer programs that provides minimal abstraction(`the context of computer programming that refers to a process of hiding complex implementation details`) from the underlying hardware. It involves direct manipulation of hardware resources and memory.

- **Example of low level programing**
  * Assembly
  * C/C++
  * Rust
  * Pascal
